# Harmonize Project: Reproducible Scripts for "Impact of Leakage on Data Harmonization in Machine Learning Pipelines in Class Imbalance Across Sites"

## About

The Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich Machine Learning Library

It is currently being developed and maintained at the [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-7/research-groups/applied-machine-learning-aml) group at [Forschungszentrum Juelich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en), Germany.

## Overview

This repository contains all scripts and resources needed to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper "Impact of Leakage on Data Harmonization in Machine Learning Pipelines in Class Imbalance Across Sites." The paper explores the effectiveness of data harmonization methods, particularly in scenarios where class balance differs across data collection sites, and proposes the **PrettYharmonize** approach to address data leakage issues. Using this repository, researchers can replicate the study results, perform experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, and validate the PrettYharmonize pipeline.

**Repository Structure**:  
`data/` - Directory for input datasets (user-provided)  
`data_preprocessing/` - Scripts for raw data preprocessing to generate the site-target dependence and independence scenarios  
`scripts/` - Main analysis scripts for all experiments 
`output/` - Results will be stored here  
`plots/` - Notebooks for figure generation  
`pyproject.toml` - Environment configuration 


## Requirements

The environment can be installed using the `pyproject.toml` file in this repository.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juaml/harmonize_project.git
   cd harmonize_project

2. **Create/activate virtual environment:**
 
Linux/Mac: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`  
Windows: `python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate`  

3. **Install dependencies:**
 
`pip install .`  
For development: `pip install -e .[dev]`

4. **Install PrettYharmonize:**  
`pip install git+https://github.com/juaml/PrettYharmonize`  

5. **Download data**

  Data must be downloaded by the user and stored in the respectively folders inside `data/`.

6. **Pre-processing data**

  The pre processing of the data has to be made using the scripts conteined in `data_preprocessing/`.

7. **Run scripts**

  The code for classification or regression in (in)dependence scenarios are stored in `scripts/`.

8. **Plot**

You can replicate the figures from the results stored in `output/`.
